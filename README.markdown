#Help is a Sublime Text2 plugin#

##Help plugin has a good name, and it does what its name suggests :

Select a text, hit `F1` (default binding), then a list of urls (default : google/mootools/php) shows up, select you url and it opens a browser (or a new tab) with the help inside.

Of course you can manage your links, to do so, `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`, and write "help manage".

It's my first sublime text2 plugin and my first piece of code in Python.

Any ideas for improvement is of course appreciated.

The plugin is strongly inspired by __Grafikart's open_browser plugin and Nettuts' Fetch plugin__.
